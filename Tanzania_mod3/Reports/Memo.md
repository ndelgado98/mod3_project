The project that has been brought to you focuses on predicting the condition of Tanzania's waterwells. Specifically, if they are working fine, which need repairs and which are faulty. 

Overview of the global water crisis: 
    Water scarcity can mean that there is lack of access to water physically, access due to the failure of institutions, or due to the lack of adequate infrastrcture. 
    Quick facts: 
        - over 844 million people lack water globally. This effects 1 out of every 10 on the planet. 
        - Lack of water locks families into poverty for generations to come
        - Women and children are worst affected by the global water crisis. Children because they are building their immune systems and access to dirty water does not help to build immunity. 
        - Women and girls because they bare the brunt of fetching and delivering water. This puts them in harms way due to lack of safety measurements put in place. 
        - A total of 200 million hours are spent each day by women and children on their trips to obtaining water for their families. 
        - Every day an average of 5 children die from diarrhea attributed to poor water sanitation  
        - 90% of all natural disasters are water related.

How does this affect Tanzania? https://water.org/our-impact/tanzania/ 
      Tanzania has a population of 57 million million. Of the 57 million only 57% have access to safe water, and only 30% have access to improved sanitation. It is because there is a lack of improved sanitation that women and girls spend a large portion of their time going to collect water from great distances. 
      Tanzania has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. Although its economy is fast growing, it is not evenly distributed throughout each sector. By focusing on its water sector, the potential for Tanzania to be economically stronger would help to alleviate poverty, and save lives. 
      A lack of investment in water resources has left a large portion of the population vulnerable. There is a vital need to maintain what water resources that are currently in use. This project looks at the waterwell's across Tanzania. The data that has will be looked at on the condition of each well. Whether it is functional, needs repair or are faulty. From here budgets can be directed at training locals to help fix the wells. Replacing it, and possibly having a spare pump for each well located within the town. This will obviously have some sort of repurcussions. 
      Mainly from the machine learning models that we have created we will then be able to understand how accurate the statistics are for safe water. From the top three classifications listed we will be able to create suggestions.
